## ❗Why
There was no way to manage my smart home devices from macOS... until last year, when Google released a [web version](https://home.google.com) of the Google Home app. Still, opening a browser just to turn on a light was cumbersome.

GHome Bar opens a small webview pointing to home.google.com in your menu tray. Once you log in, you can manage your smart devices easily.

## ✨ Features
 * Everything Google Home for Web offers, but in your menu bar:
   * Manage Devices
   * Start/Create Automations
   * Control cameras
